/*
Code can be used to enable adjusting the timing of a video. 
The context of a lesson can be used to determine whether a video should 
start or pause at a certain time stamp, or a video may have a second or so 
of a blank screen before the content starts. In either of these cases, 
the code below can be added to adjust the timing of the video.
*/

//to adjust the starting point of a video
// declare variables
const {media1} = components; 
media1.on('ready',() => {
	media1.skipTo(0.7);
}); // 0.7 is the time in seconds; change to the desired start time (up to tenths of a second)

//to pause a video at a certain time
//declare variables
const {media1} = components;
media1.on('crosstime', () => {
  media1.pause();
  console.log('the video reached 24s mark')
  }, { time: 24 }); // 24 is the time in seconds; change to desired pause time (up to tenths of a second); console.log statement is for troubleshooting
