/*
Passing data entered in a text input to a table cell on a different slide:

This is a special case of code that can be used to have data entered in a textInput 
on one slide populate a cell in a table on a different slide. This can allow the user 
to only focus on one part of a larger table without having to show the entire table (e.g.,
for writing a Concept Statement).

This code may often be used in conjunction with a larger set of data transfer code 
between tables as in the passTable file. If that is the case, there is no reason to repeat 
the declaration of variables. If that is not the case, then use the full set of example code here.
*/

// declare variables 
const {snakeTableUpdate} = components; //this is the table on the current slide

let receivingTable = snakeTableUpdate; // remember to update the receivingTable with the table name above

//note that this slide code might be different from the sendingTable slide code, so slideID is not used
receivingTable.updateCell(0, 0, {
   value:getFromSlide('slide-efea46c11205', 'textInput1.data.text'), editable: true});
