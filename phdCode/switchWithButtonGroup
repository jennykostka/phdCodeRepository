/*
Multiple buttons that show a different image when each button is clicked:

This code uses the buttonGroup to reveal a new component when each new button is activated. 
The components could be images, textDisplay or textInput but images will be most common. 
Rename the components in the code to match what is on the slide. This code sequence is useful 
when the lesson calls for showing several images along with a question or as part of an activity guide.
This code can also be used with other types of components, not just images.

To keep your code and slides organized, keep component names numbered or rename 
them so they describe their contents. This will make it easier to keep track of your code. 

If fewer than 3 components are needed on the slide, simply delete the matched line of code 
for the component and button not needed as well as that section from the bottom of the code. 

If more than 3 are needed, add a matched line of code for additional components to each section, 
as well as a new section for each additional component.
