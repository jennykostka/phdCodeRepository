/*
Single button (not group) that toggles two images back and forth:

This code just uses the single button as a toggle between two components. 
At no point is there nothing on the screen and the button itself never appears “deactivated.” 

* This code can also be used with other types of components, not just images.

See Slide 12 in Appendix B Coding Examples deck:

*/

// declare variables 
const {image1, image2, button1} = components;

// this section hides the second image from being seen until the button is pressed
image2.updateData({visible: false});

// this section switches to the other component when the button is pressed and allows for the button to be pressed again to continue the switching
button1.on('click', () => {
  if(!image1.data.init) {
  image1.updateData({visible: true});
  image2.updateData({visible: false});
  image1.updateData({"init": true});
}
else {
  image1.updateData({visible: false});
  image2.updateData({visible: true});
  image1.updateData({"init": false});
}
})
