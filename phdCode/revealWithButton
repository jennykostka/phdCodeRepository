/*
Single buttonGroup that reveals hidden content:
This code uses the buttonGroup to reveal hidden components when activated. 
The hidden components could be images, textDisplay or textInput. 
Rename the components in the code to match what is on the slide. 
This code sequence is useful for hiding optional instructions or activities that are 
shared at a teacherâ€™s discretion (homework) or should only be revealed when the 
teacher chooses (e.g., Teacher Text).
